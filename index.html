    <p>The year is 2020 -- everything is not as it seems. It all began with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cars</li>
      <li>7 people</li>
      <li>and many hills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The setting is Lake Arrowhead. It's a cute and quaint town, but in the
      distance a burning threat approaches. However, these 7 kids are no
      ordinary 20 year olds.
